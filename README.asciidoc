About
-----

*Aventura no Rato!* is a browser based, adventure type, game developed by three 
students learning the PHP programming language. The goal is to develop a complete 
system that includes the game, a forum system, a website and some statistical 
information.

With this project the students will learn the basic tasks associated with software 
development, use helping tools like Git and learn how to develop in PHP and how a 
complete and mid-size system is built.

The objectives involve:
[horizontal]
Development:: Understand and use correct development methods and tools, this 
includes using version control systems (Git), properly document the code, auxiliary
tools and scripts (bash scripts for database automation, packaging, etc), properly 
structure project files.

Code:: Learn PHP using objected oriented approaches, create _boostramp_ files and 
basic template system with separation between request controllers and views. 
Learn SQL, JS and CSS in a very basic way.

Fun:: Develop a project that could be fun to create and fun to use and something 
that can be shown to friends :).
